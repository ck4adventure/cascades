# Cascades
Implementation of a basic match 3 game where the tiles fall down, creating potentially more matches in a cascade.  

Started with some code from ChatGPT, but it was so flawed I decided to work out my own logic.

### Current Status
Working cascade feature.

### Up Next
- Reset button
- slow down the animations if possible

### Eventual Features
- refactor into a class based program
- light and dark mode
- custom height and width
- custom number of color types
