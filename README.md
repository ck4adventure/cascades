# Cascades
Implementation of a basic match 3 game where the tiles fall down, creating potentially more matches in a cascade

### Current Status
Matches in both horizontal and vertical direction set to null
Still allows pieces to be moved even if no match created

### Next Steps
Work on not allowing a move unless a match is created
Add logic for filling in the empty spots by shifting squares above them downwards
Add logic to scan for new matches made once board full again
Add logic to continue filling in pieces and eliminating matches until the 'cascade' stops and board is full again
