# Cascades
Implementation of a basic match 3 game where the tiles fall down, creating potentially more matches in a cascade.  

Started with some code from ChatGPT, but it was so flawed I decided to work out my own logic.

### Current Status
Working fill in of tiles from top to bottom. 

### Next Steps
- Add logic to scan for new matches made once board full again
- Add logic to continue filling in pieces and eliminating matches until the 'cascade' stops and board is full again

### Eventual Features
- light and dark mode
- custom height and width
- custom number of color types
